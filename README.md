## Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we perfomed the follwoign tasks:

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:

- What is the overall sales trend?
- Which products are top sellers?
- What are the peak sales periods?

## Data Analysis

Include some interesting code

## Results/Finding

The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1. The company's sales

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:
- Invest in marketing and promotions during peak sales seasons to maximise revenue
- Focus on expanding and promoting products in Category 4
- Implement a customer segmentation strategy to target high paying customers effectively

## Limitations

There are still a few outliers even after the omissions but even then we can still see that there is a positive correlation between budget and number of votes with revenue.
